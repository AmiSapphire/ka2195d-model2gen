# ka2195d-model2gen
Project that aims to fix the Model 2 Sega Genesis's composite video clock that uses the console's crystal oscillator instead of using an external one.

This repo contains the schematic, PCBs, and Gerber files for the Composite Video clock fix for Model 2 Sega Genesis consoles: revision VA0, VA1, and VA1.8 boards. Removal of R61 on the console's board is **_required_**.
